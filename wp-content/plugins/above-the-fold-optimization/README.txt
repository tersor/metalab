This plugin enables to pass the "Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content"-rule from Google PageSpeed Insights to be able to obtain a high PageSpeed score using other optimization plugins such as W3 Total Cache.

== Description ==

This plugin enables to pass the "`Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content`"-rule from [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

The functionality of this plugin is simple and light-weight. The plugin simply inserts Critical Path CSS code inline, helps to create it and optionally optimizes the delivery of the full website CSS.

The plugin is intended to work together with other optimization plugins such as [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/), [WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) and [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/).

Using just 3 plugins and default settings it is possible to achieve a PageSpeed 100-score. The following demo is an original WordPress blog ``v4.2.2`` with the default theme, [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/) javascript and CSS optimization, [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) for full-page cache and the Above The Fold Optimization plugin.

**Note:** *This plugin is intended to achieve the best possible result, not easy usage. It is intended for advanced WordPress users and optimization professionals.*

### Automated Critical Path CSS generation

The plugin enables automated Critical Path CSS generation via [Penthouse.js](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse). The plugin will execute Penthouse.js to generate Critical Path CSS for multiple responsive dimensions and pages, combines the resulting CSS-code and then compresses the CSS-code via [Clean-CSS](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css).

If custom installation of software is not possible on the server it is possible to use an online Critical Path CSS generator based on Penthouse.js on the following address:

http://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/

Other Critical Path CSS generators are [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) and [Critical CSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalcss) which are available as Node.js and Grunt.js modules.

== Installation ==

To make use of automated Critical Path CSS generation it is required to install the following software on the server:

1. [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/): ``npm install -g phantomjs``
2. [Clean-CSS](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css): ``npm install -g clean-css``

To be able to generate Critical Path CSS from within the WordPress admin the software needs to be executable from PHP which may pose a security risk. An alternative option is to generate a CLI command to execute via SSH.

### WordPress plugin installation

1. Upload the `above-the-fold-optimization/` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the plugin settings-page
4. Configure and start the Critical Path Generator
